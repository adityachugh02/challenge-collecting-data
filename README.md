## Description

This is a data-scraping project in the real estate sector in Belgium.
This project was realised using Immoweb.be data for a Becode exercise. 
The end-goal of gathering this data is to create a machine-learning model for ImmoEliza to make price predictions on real estate. 


## Installation

This program was written using Python 3.10 and is meant to be run directly through the Terminal. 
Once started, this program will autamatically scrap and save the data collected in a csv file.
This is performed using the Pandas library. 

 
## Usage

This program is only used to scrap real estate data in Belgium, including apartments and house 
but excluding Life annuity sales. 


## Contributors
This program was a group effort from Aditya Chug, Tony Anciaux and Rosyidah Nadia.
The three of us took part in this project as a part of an exercise for our BeCode AI Program in Brussels.


## Timeline
This 4-days project was realised between January 28th and February 1st 2022.
